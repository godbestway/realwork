ctrl_share = 1 means, only use the framework without conn-action technique
call the function action_get_sharestate_perflow instead of action_get_perflow to send a completed state
connac_init don't need to open the state channel, only open the action channel

ctrl_sfc means, support sfc mode
ctrl_sfc = 0, conn_send_putPerflowAck process as normal
ctrl_sfc = 1, NF directly use this function sfc_send_putPerflowAck from library 

sfc-NAT
use a fixed port instead of dynamic random port
uint16_t table_get_external_port(uint32_t hash,uint32_t cxid)
external_port = (hash+cxid) % (MAX_EXTERNAL_PORT - MIN_EXTERNAL_PORT) + MIN_EXTERNAL_PORT;

"ctrl_adnatfire"
advanced mode for NAT and firewall, only need to open the conn channel
