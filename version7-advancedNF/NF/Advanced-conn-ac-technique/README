NAT uses a the parameter ctrl_adnatfire, to avoid sending the action state in table.c
if(ad_nat_firewall == 0) don't send action state in table.c

Firewall uses a traditional way, delete all the action state related part.

Prads send the action and conn state as normal but only the conn states will be checked.
